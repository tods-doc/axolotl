## About Data Driven Discovery Program

DARPA Data Driven Discovery (D3M) Program is researching ways to get machines to build
machine learning pipelines automatically. It is split into three layers:
TA1 (primitives), TA2 (systems which combine primitives automatically into pipelines
and executes them), and TA3 (end-users interfaces).
